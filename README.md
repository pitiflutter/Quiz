# Quiz App

This is a simple Swift app that serves as my first project. It aims to help users learn about views, the MVC model, structs, clean code practices, and updating the user interface (UI).

## Features

- Intuitive user interface
- MVC architecture
- Structs for data organization
- Clean code implementation
- UI updates

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.

## Usage

The app presents a quiz with multiple-choice questions. Users can select an answer and submit it. The app then displays whether the answer is correct or incorrect. After completing the quiz, users can view their final score.
